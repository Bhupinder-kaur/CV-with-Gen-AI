Title: Computer Vision Project: Generating Realistic Horse Images
Description:

This project aims to leverage generative AI, specifically the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture, to create highly realistic images of horses. By training a GAN on a dataset of horse images, we aim to generate new, diverse, and visually appealing horse images that can be used for various applications, such as:

Art and Design: Creating unique and artistic horse-themed visuals.
Research: Studying horse anatomy and behavior.
Gaming and Animation: Generating realistic horse models for virtual environments.
Key Features:

GAN Architecture: Utilizes a GAN to learn the underlying patterns and characteristics of horse images.
Dataset: Trains on a large dataset of high-quality horse images.
Evaluation Metrics: Employs metrics like Inception Score (IS) and Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) to assess the quality and diversity of generated images.
Customization: Allows for customization of the GAN architecture and training parameters to explore different styles and variations of horse images.
